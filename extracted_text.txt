l If a € R*. then a trace of the matrix aa’ is equal to the Buclidean distance |

between the origin and the point a.
PCA becomes equivalent to LDA if we project samples of each class using PCA |

| independently.

For a particular x, the value of the probability mass function can be greater than |

one.

The PCA will project 2D-data points to [1, O\? if variance(x) > variance(y). |

| If data distributions exactly follow y=x, then the rank of the covariance matrix |
| Tse

will be zero. |

| |
If X and Y are two real-valued random variables such that Cou(X ,.Y) <0 Chew) | |
at least one of X or Y must have negative variance i.e. either o(X) < 0 or | bolee - |
ay) <0. | |
|

Naive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the | a

class label.
LDA is sensitive to outliers in the dataset.

|
A die is loaded so that the probability of a face coming up is proportional to the |
number on that face. The die is rolled with outcome X. The expected value of X

is greater than 4.

  

| B = {[1, 1)”, [-1, 0]"} is one of the basis in 2D-space.
