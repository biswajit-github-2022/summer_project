TRUE/FALSE SN Statement FALSE If a E Rd, then a trace of the matrix aa is equal to the Euclidean distance between the origin and the point a. PCA becomes equivalent to LDA if we project samples of each class using PCA TRUE 2 independently. For a particular x, the value of the probability mass function can be greater than FALSE 3 one. TRUE The PCA will project 2D-data points to [1,0]T if variance(x>variancey 4 5 If data distributions exactly follow y=x, then the rank of the covariance matrix TRUE will be zero. If X and Y are two real-valued random variables such that CovX,Y0 then 6 Y0. TRRE 7 Naive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class label. FALSE LDA is sensitive to outliers in the dataset 8 9 A die is loaded so that the probability of a face coming up is proportional to the TRUE number on that face. The die is rolled with outcome X.The expected value of X is greater than 4. TRUE B={[11]T[-1,0]} is one of the basis in 2D-space. 10
